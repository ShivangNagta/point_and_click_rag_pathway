Maria loved exploring old libraries. One rainy afternoon, she discovered a dusty book titled “The Forgotten Maps”. Inside, she found sketches of hidden gardens in her city, along with cryptic notes about a key hidden under an old oak tree in Central Park.

Inside was a golden key and a note saying: “The adventure is only beginning.”
